# ❄️ Welcome to the Nix/NixOS Israel User Group ❄️

---

Our group is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about Nix and NixOS, whether you are a seasoned user or just getting started. We welcome developers, system administrators, DevOps engineers, and anyone who is interested in exploring the world of Nix and NixOS.

At our events, we will discuss a variety of topics related to NixOS and Nix, including system configuration, software deployment, package management, software development, and more. Talks will happen in the future as the local Nix community grows larger.

We believe that by bringing together individuals who are passionate about NixOS and Nix, we can build a strong community in Israel that can support, help each other and increase the adoption of Nix in Israel.
